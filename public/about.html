<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>my name is sneha Anand Das .I am from Nepal.
  I am first year student pursuing computer science and technology at Iiest , shibpur.
  
  I am interested in coding, music and video editing.
  As I take my first step into the dynamic world of hackathons. Currently I have keen interest in frontend development. And I have been consistently learning it. Currently I haven't worked in any such project.
  
  However, I see this event as a fantastic opportunity to learn, collaborate, and build a foundation for future project contributions. I am eager to engage with experienced mentors and fellow participants who can guide me on this exciting journey.
  I am ready to embrace the challenges, push my boundaries, and absorb as much knowledge as possible.</p>
